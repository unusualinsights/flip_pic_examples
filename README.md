# FLIP/PIC Examples

This repository provides example code for developing a FLIP/PIC fluid
simulator.

This code expands on the code provided with Dr. Adam Bargteil and Dr. Tamar
Shinar's [SIGGRAPH course on physics-based animation](https://cal.cs.umbc.edu/Courses/PhysicsBasedAnimation/).

A great set of [references](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/fluidsimulation/)
for connecting the implementation to the underlying theories on the physics of
fluids have been created by Dr. Robert Bridson and Dr. Matthias MÃ¼ller-Fischer.
A lot of the concepts implemented in this code are explained in their
materials.
