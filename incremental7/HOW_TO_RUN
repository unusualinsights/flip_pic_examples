make
./RunFluidSimulator
./ParticleViewer fluid.%03d.part

Then, do either:
   ./GenerateMovie
OR
   ./GenerateGIF

Then watch the movie, out.mp4 or out.gif. To open either of these from the
command line directly in Ubuntu, just run:
   xdg-open out.mp4
OR
   xdg-open out.gif

To clean up:
./CleanFiles
make clean
