make
./RunFluidSimulator

This displays the simulation, but also generates .png image files with which to
make a movie or animated GIF below:

./ParticleViewer fluid.%03d.part

Close the display window or type CTRL+C in the Terminal once the images are
done being generated once, i.e., when you see the output in the Terminal change
from generating the last image to simply displaying the images all over again
from the beginning:

147 / 147

148 / 148

reading fluid.150.part

2 / 150
3 / 150
4 / 150
5 / 150

Then, do either:
   ./GenerateMovie
OR
   ./GenerateGIF

Then watch the movie, out.mp4 or out.gif. To open either of these from the
command line directly in Ubuntu, just run:
   xdg-open out.mp4
OR
   xdg-open out.gif

To clean up:
./CleanFiles
make clean
